# 🚔 TraffiGuard: AI-Powered Automated Traffic Violation & Suspicious Behavior Detection System

> A Smart Policing System for Safer Roads and Public Spaces
---
## 🚀 Project Overview

TraffiGuard is an AI-powered smart surveillance system designed to automate traffic rule enforcement and detect suspicious public behavior in real time using video feeds from drones and CCTV cameras. Our system is tailored for modern **Smart City** and **Smart Policing** infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Road Traffic Violations:
- High rates of road accidents due to speeding, red-light jumping, helmetless riding, and lane indiscipline.
- Manual surveillance is inefficient, error-prone, and risky for personnel.
- Many violations go unnoticed in crowded or remote locations.

### Public Safety & Surveillance:
- Difficulty in detecting threats like unattended baggage, loitering, or armed individuals in real time.
- Manual monitoring can't scale to large urban spaces.
- Lack of immediate actionable response tools.

## 🧠 Our Solution

A unified AI-driven platform that addresses both traffic enforcement and public surveillance challenges.

### 📸 **Traffic Violation Detection**
- Real-time video parsing from live CCTV and drone feeds.
- Detection of:
  - 🚦 Signal Jumping
  - 🚫 Speeding
  - 🪖 Helmet-less Riding
- Vehicle tracking and violation classification using object detection and motion analytics.

### 🎥 **Suspicious Behavior Detection**
- Monitors public zones for:
  - Loitering
  - Sudden crowd dispersals
  - Abandoned bags or weapons
- Sends **real-time alerts** to the command center.
- Drones may deploy non-lethal measures upon approval.

### 🛰️ **Drone-Based Real-Time Action**
- Surveillance drones broadcast warnings.
- Stream live feed to control center.
- Capable of deploying **non-lethal crowd control** tools (e.g., flash sound, gas) with authorization.
